# UiPath Maestro BPMN

Work with UiPath Maestro (Process Orchestration) `.bpmn` projects across their
lifecycle: author, validate, package, operate, and diagnose. **Authoring is
registry-driven**: every `uipath:*` extension payload comes from a template the
registry serves; the structural BPMN that holds those nodes together (process
scaffold, sequence flows, gateways, events, boundary events, containers,
multi-instance markers, and the diagram) is authored from the documented spec +
canvas contract. Packaging, operating (upload, publish, run, manage), and
diagnosing are driven through the UiPath CLI, covered in the capability
references below.

## When to use

- Create a Maestro `.bpmn` from a description.
- Edit `.bpmn` structure: gateways, events, boundary events, subprocesses, call
  activities, multi-instance loops, sequence-flow conditions, variables.
- Add a UiPath extension node (RPA job, agent, HITL, queue, business rule, API
  workflow, Integration Service connector, internal message, timer).
- Validate a `.bpmn` against the canvas rules before import.
- Package, upload, publish, or run a project, and manage its jobs and instances.
- Diagnose a failed or misbehaving run.

### Editing an existing `.bpmn` (preserve what you did not author)

The skill can edit an existing file. Make **surgical** edits and preserve
content you did not author: unknown `uipath:*` elements, `uipath:migrationVersion`,
tags, imported Integration Service payloads, and stable element IDs. Do not
regenerate the whole file or drop extension data the skill does not recognize —
preserve-only structures (see the blocklist in
[references/structural-bpmn.md](references/structural-bpmn.md)) round-trip
untouched.

For `.flow` JSON use `uipath-maestro-flow`; for XAML/coded workflows use
`uipath-rpa`; for Python agents use `uipath-agents`; for Case plans use
`uipath-maestro-case`.

## The model

Two halves make a valid Maestro `.bpmn`:

1. **`uipath:*` payloads — registry-owned.** Each node's extension XML
   (`uipath:activity` / `uipath:event` / `uipath:mapping`, its `context`,
   `input`, `output`, and `bindingInfo`) comes from
   `uip maestro bpmn registry get <type>`'s `xmlTemplate`. **Never hand-author a
   `uipath:*` element from prose.**
2. **Structural BPMN — spec/canvas-owned.** The registry emits no
   `<bpmn:definitions>`/`<bpmn:process>`, no sequence flows, no gateway
   conditions/defaults, no event-definition payloads, no boundary-event
   attributes, no subprocess/loop structure, and no diagram. Author all of these
   from [references/structural-bpmn.md](references/structural-bpmn.md), which is
   grounded in the registry spec and the Studio Web canvas serializer.

## Workflow

Work the four steps quickly, but keep the path matched to the user's ask. For
discovery-only asks (for example, "show what the registry exposes" or "capture
the template for X"), run `registry pull`, then `list` / `search`, then
`registry get <type> --output json` for the requested types; save or report the
raw evidence and do not scaffold a project. For authoring asks, read a reference
only when you reach the structure it covers, get the needed templates, then
write the first complete draft before further spelunking.

1. **Discover.** `uip maestro bpmn registry pull` **once** (cached for the
   session — do not re-pull), then `list` / `search` to map intent to extension
   types; `uip is connections list --all-folders` for live connections (always
   `--all-folders` — a folder-scoped list silently misses connections). Confirm
   every selection with the user (use AskUserQuestion). Never fabricate an identifier.
   See [references/registry-workflow.md](references/registry-workflow.md).
2. **Get templates.** `uip maestro bpmn registry get <type> --output json` for
   each chosen registry-owned node only. Enrich `Intsvc.*` connector nodes with
   `--connection-id`/`--object-name`. Do not call `registry get` for structural
   gaps the registry never owns: sequence flows, gateways, events, boundary
   events, multi-instance/loop markers, `errorMapping`/retry structure, or
   diagrams.
3. **Assemble.** Author directly from the complete minimal file in
   [references/structural-bpmn.md](references/structural-bpmn.md#a-complete-minimal-file-author-from-this-not-from-examples)
   plus each node's `xmlTemplate` (fill placeholders only). That skeleton already
   shows variables, the entry point, a branch, and the diagram. **Do not
   reverse-engineer authoring patterns from task fixtures or generated package
   files** — fixture spelunking is the top reason authoring runs out of time.
   Add only the structural pieces your process needs (extra
   gateways, events, boundary events, containers, multi-instance markers,
   expression/error mappings, retry attributes), then generate one
   `BPMNShape`/`BPMNEdge` per node and flow. For local authoring prompts, use the
   plain project layout `<ProjectName>/<ProjectName>.bpmn` with
   `<ProjectName>/project.uiproj`; do not create `*Solution/`, package files, or
   `.uipx` artifacts unless the user explicitly asks to package or operate the
   project.
4. **Validate.** Run the CLI validator — it runs the full PO.Frontend canvas
   rule set (structural rules plus variable, method-call, input-type, and
   event-object checks) offline, plus deploy-readiness checks:

   ```bash
   uip maestro bpmn validate <file.bpmn> --output json
   ```

   Exit 0 = valid; exit 1 = validation failed (the envelope lists each issue
   with its rule code). Warnings are reported but do not fail the run. Validate
   once; fix only error-severity findings. Do not re-validate in a loop chasing
   warnings. If `validate` reports "unknown command" or clearly skips the
   structural rules, the installed CLI predates them — update it (see
   [references/cli-conventions.md](references/cli-conventions.md)). See
   [references/structural-bpmn.md#validation](references/structural-bpmn.md#validation).

## Operate and diagnose

Beyond authoring, this skill packages, ships, runs, and diagnoses Maestro
projects through the UiPath CLI.

- **Package and operate** (package a project, upload to Studio Web, publish or
  deploy, run or debug instances, and manage jobs, instances, incidents, and
  lifecycle actions): see [references/operate/CAPABILITY.md](references/operate/CAPABILITY.md).
- **Diagnose** (fetch incidents, variables, and element executions, and trace a
  failed run back to its BPMN element): see [references/diagnose/CAPABILITY.md](references/diagnose/CAPABILITY.md).

Any cloud-side change (upload, publish, deploy, run, pause, resume, cancel,
retry, migrate) requires explicit user consent, and local validation should pass
first.

## Structural coverage

This skill teaches authoring of the full surface the canvas supports. What the
registry serves a template for vs. what you author by hand:

| Structure | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Node `uipath:*` payloads (RPA, agent, HITL, queue, business rule, API workflow, IS connector, internal message, timer, script, variables) | **Registry** `xmlTemplate` |
| `<bpmn:definitions>`/`<bpmn:process>` scaffold + namespaces | Authored (registry gap) |
| Sequence flows, `conditionExpression`, gateway `default` | Authored (registry gap) |
| Gateways: exclusive, parallel, inclusive, event-based (complex is preserve-only) | Authored (registry gap) |
| Events + event-definition matrix: message, timer, error, terminate (end-only). Signal/escalation/conditional/link/compensate/cancel/multiple are preserve-only | Authored (registry gap); payload per canvas serializer |
| Boundary events: `attachedToRef`, interrupting/non-interrupting (`cancelActivity`) | Authored (registry gap) |
| Subprocess, event subprocess (`triggeredByEvent`), call activity | Authored (registry gap); call-activity payloads from registry |
| Multi-instance / loop characteristics | Authored from canvas contract — **registry exposes no template (registry gap)** |
| `bpmndi:BPMNDiagram` (shape per node, edge per flow) | Always generated — **registry emits none (registry gap)** |

Flagged registry gaps: the registry serves no template for structural BPMN,
sequence-flow conditions, event-definition payloads, boundary-event attributes,
multi-instance markers, or the diagram. These are authored from the spec +
canvas contract in [references/structural-bpmn.md](references/structural-bpmn.md)
and honestly surfaced to the user as gaps when asked.

## Rules

1. **Registry owns every `uipath:*` payload.** Author from
   `registry get` templates; never hand-write `uipath:` XML from prose.
2. **Never fabricate an identifier.** Connection IDs, process/queue/connector
   keys, app IDs, folder ids/paths come from discovery or the user.
3. **Structural BPMN is authored, not invented.** Follow the spec/canvas
   contract in [references/structural-bpmn.md](references/structural-bpmn.md);
   flag honestly what the registry does not expose.
4. **Confirm before authoring.** Confirm the chosen connector/connection/process
   and the process structure with the user (AskUserQuestion).
5. **The diagram is mandatory.** Import is diagram-driven — every node needs a
   `BPMNShape`, every flow a `BPMNEdge`, or it will not appear on the canvas.
6. **Node type is a child element, never an attribute.** Every `uipath:activity`
   / `uipath:event` / `uipath:mapping` declares its type as
   `<uipath:type value="<Type>" version="v1" />` inside the wrapper. Never write
   `<uipath:activity type="…">` — the canvas will not recognize the node.
7. **No `--` in XML comments.** XML forbids `--` (double-hyphen) inside
   `<!-- … -->`, so never paste CLI commands or flags (`--output`,
   `--connection-id`, `--object-name`) into a comment — it makes the file
   unparseable. Keep comments minimal.
8. **Use `--output json` for parsed CLI calls.**
9. **Public-safe always.** No customer XML, tenant URLs, real IDs, or private
   names — see [references/public-safety.md](references/public-safety.md).
10. **Confirm before any cloud change.** Upload, publish, deploy, run, pause,
   resume, cancel, retry, and migrate require explicit user consent; validate
   locally first.
