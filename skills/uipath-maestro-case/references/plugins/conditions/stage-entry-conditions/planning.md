# stage-entry-conditions — Planning

Conditions that control **when a stage is entered**. Attach to a stage; fire when the inbound rule is satisfied.

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md **literally uses the phrase "stage entry condition"** (or close variants: "stage entry conditions", "entry rule on stage", "entry gate on <stage>").

For when a stage **exits**, use [stage-exit-conditions](../stage-exit-conditions/planning.md). For when a specific **task** starts, use [task-entry-conditions](../task-entry-conditions/planning.md).

## No omission — one T-task per sdd.md Entry Condition row

Every stage with an **Entry Condition** declared in sdd.md gets its own stage-entry-condition T-task — **including rule-type `case-entered`** and stages with `is-interrupting: false`. Never skip a condition because the rule-type or field values look like defaults. If sdd.md wrote the row, `tasks.md` emits the T-task.

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `<stage-id>` | previously captured from the stages plugin | Target stage |
| `display-name` | sdd.md Display Name column (optional) | Carry the SDD value verbatim. Omit when the SDD cell is blank / `—` — do NOT invent one; impl defaults it to `Entry Rule {N}`. e.g., "Pre-check", "Interrupt on Fraud" |
| `is-interrupting` | sdd.md (default `false`) | `true` if the condition interrupts the current stage. Required for every secondary-stage entry row; `false` is for regular-stage entry only. |
| `rule-type` | Pick from the catalog below | See §Rule-type catalog |
| `selected-stage-id` | Required for `selected-stage-*` rule-types | ID of the referenced stage |
| `connector fields` | SDD **Connector Rule Detail** block | `type-id` (activity-type-id), `connector-key`, `connection-id`, `object-name`, `event-operation`, `event-mode`, `input-values`, optional `filter` — resolved via [connector-trigger-common.md § Planning Pipeline](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#planning-pipeline) |
| `condition-expression` | Optional on any rule-type | Extra `=js:` gate on **case state** (`=js:vars.X ...`) — NOT the event payload (no `event` namespace) |
| `outputs` | SDD **Connector Rule Outputs** block | Optional. `->` (extract field → case var) or `=` (assign expression → case var). See [connector-trigger-common.md § tasks.md fields (planning)](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#tasksmd-fields-planning). |

## Rule-Type Catalog (stage-entry scope)

Allowed `ruleType` values and when to pick each:

| Rule type | Meaning | Extra fields |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `case-entered` | Fires the moment the case is entered (first stage pattern) | — |
| `selected-stage-completed` | Fires when a specific upstream stage completes | `selectedStageId` |
| `selected-stage-exited` | Fires when a specific upstream stage exits (even without completing) | `selectedStageId` |
| `user-selected-stage` | Fires when an upstream stage exits via a `wait-for-user` exit condition and the user selects this stage as the next one. Only stages carrying this rule appear in the picker. | — |
| `wait-for-connector` | Waits for a connector event (binds an IS connector trigger under `uipath`) | connector fields (above); `conditionExpression` optional |

`is-interrupting: true` means the condition can fire **while another stage is active** and will interrupt it. Use it on every secondary-stage entry row. If a candidate secondary stage would use `is-interrupting: false`, it is misclassified: use a regular stage/path or an `adhoc` task instead.

> **First-stage start — `case-entered` is the case-start signal (edges retired).** With edges gone, there is no Trigger→first-stage edge; the case begins at the stage whose entry condition is `case-entered`. **At least one regular stage must carry `case-entered`**, or the case can never start. The sdd.md's first stage normally declares it — emit it verbatim. If NO stage declares `case-entered`, flag to the user via AskUserQuestion; do NOT silently inject one (Rule 2 — trust the sdd.md, no gap-fill). The reachability walk in [`sdd-generation-rules.md` § Logical integrity](../../../sdd-generation-rules.md) treats a case with no `case-entered` stage as a blocking orphan.

## Ordering

Stage entry conditions are created **after** all stages exist (Step 7 in implementation.md). Source/target stage IDs must both be captured by then.

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T<n>: Add stage-entry condition for "<stage>" — <summary>
- target-stage: "<stage-name>"
- display-name: "<name>"   # optional — omit when SDD Display Name cell is blank; impl defaults to "Entry Rule {N}"
- is-interrupting: false
- rule-type: selected-stage-completed
- selected-stage: "<upstream-stage-name>"
- condition-expression: "=js:vars.X..."   # optional gate on case state, NOT the event payload
- order: after T<m>
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture ConditionId
```

> `rule-type: wait-for-connector` also needs the connector fields — see [connector-trigger-common.md § tasks.md fields (planning)](../../../connector-trigger-common.md#tasksmd-fields-planning).
